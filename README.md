# Motivational Message Microservice

This microservice analyzes journal entries for sentiment and provides a motivational message based on the sentiment. It is built using FastAPI and a pre-trained sentiment analysis model.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Python Dependencies**  
   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Ensure JSON File Availability**  
   Make sure `motivational_messages.json` is in the same directory as `app.py`. It contains the motivational messages used by the service.

## Starting the FastAPI Server

Activate the virtual environment by running the following command in the root directory:

### Windows
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### macOS/Linux
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### With the venv activated, run:
```bash
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```
The server will start on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.

## API Usage

{
  "positivity_score": "47.89%",
  "motivational_message": "Every setback is a setup for a comeback. Keep going!"
}
```
